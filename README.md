# Essential Firefox
ðŸ¦Š A list of all the FireFox add-ons that I consider essential.

## General
- [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword/extensions) - Extension for the 1Password app, one of the best password managers for macOS.
- [Awesome Autocomplete For Github](https://github.com/algolia/github-awesome-autocomplete) - Adds autocomplete for GitHub's search bar.
- [Refined GitHub](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github#-refined-github---) - Adds several fixes and features to GitHub's UI.
- [Reddit Enhacement Suite](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite#reddit-enhancement-suite) - Includes many features that enhances your Reddit browsing experience.
- [GitHub Stars](https://github.com/jorgegonzalez/github-stars#%EF%B8%8F-github-stars-%EF%B8%8F) - Adds a link to your starred repositories on GitHub's navigation bar. Useful if you use starring as a way to bookmark repos (as I do).
- [Magic Actions for YouTube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/magic-actions-for-youtube/) - Adds several features to enhance your YouTube watching experience. *(currently looking for an open source alternative, suggestions are welcome).*
- [Imagus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imagus/) - Enlarge thumbnails, and show images/videos from links with a mouse hover. Useful for browsing Reddit. *(currently looking for an open source alternative, suggestions are welcome).*

## Privacy and Security
- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) - The best content blocker available for FireFox.
- [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) - Forces HTTPS connections whenever possible.
- [Decentraleyes](https://github.com/Synzvato/decentraleyes#decentraleyes) - Improves privacy by intercepting requests to large third-party CDNs ([more info](https://github.com/Synzvato/decentraleyes/wiki/Simple-Introduction)).
- [Nano Defender](https://github.com/NanoAdblocker/NanoDefender#nano-defender) - Stops sites from trying to make you turn off your content blocker. Requires [additional installation steps](https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/) if using with uBlock Origin.

## Development
- [Octotree](https://github.com/buunguyen/octotree#octotree) - Adds a code tree for exploring repositories.
- [Octolinker](https://octolinker.github.io) - Turns language-specific module-loading statements in source files into links.
- [Font Finder](https://github.com/andy-portmen/font-finder) - Allows you to analyze the font information of any element on a page.
- [React Developer Tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools#react-developer-tools-) - Lets you inspect the React component hierarchy, including component props and state. Indisposable when creating React apps.
